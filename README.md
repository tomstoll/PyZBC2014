# Introduction
PyZBC2014 is a barebones Python 3 wrapper around the Zilany, Bruce, and Carney (2014) auditory-nerve (AN) model, which is written in C.
Currently, PyZBC2014 is set up as a Python package (i.e., it can be imported like `import pyzbc2014 as zbc` in Python scripts).

PyZBC2014 is licensed under the GNU AGPLv3 license (see `LICENSE`).
Please send any questions or issues to `daniel_guest@urmc.rochester.edu`, or raise an issue on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/guestdaniel/PyZBC2014).

# Usage
PyZBC2014 defines two functions, `sim_ihc_zbc2014` and `sim_anrate_zbc2014`, to simulate inner-hair-cell (IHC) potentials from sound-pressure waveforms or AN instantaneous rates from IHC potentials, respectively.
Comparing to the origianl MATLAB/Mex implementation of the 2014 model, these behave similarly to the `IHCAN` and `Synapse` functions, respectively, with some small differences in behavior and some improvements in quality-of-life.

## Simulate IHC response
To simulate an IHC response, you need to provide a sound-pressure waveform in 1D Numpy vector format to the `sim_ihc_zbc2014` function; it will return an IHC potential waveform of exactly the same size and format.
Parameters can be modified by keyword arguments:
- `cf`: Characteristic frequency (Hz)
- `nrep`: Number of reps to generate (only a single rep is simulated, others are appended copies)
- `fs`: Sampling rate (Hz), should generally be at least 100 kHz, and higher for cat/very-high-CF simulations; note that your stimulus must be sampled at this frequency!
- `cohc`: Status of the outer hair cells, in range of [0, 1] with 1 being fully normal/healthy
- `cihc`: Status of the inner hair cells, in range of [0, 1] with 1 being fully normal/healthy
- `species`: String encoding species to use in [`"cat"`, `"human"`, `"human-glasberg"`]. In the MATLAB/Mex wrapper, `species=1` corresponds to `"cat"`, `species=2` corresponds to `"human"` (and indicates human with the sharp peripheral tuning suggested by Shera and Oxenham), and `species=3` corresponds to `"human-glasberg"` (and indicates broader peripheral tuning suggested by Glasberg and Moore)

The full function call using default keyword arguments is thus:
```
ihc_potential = sim_ihc_zbc2014(px, cf=1e3, nrep=1, fs=100e3, cohc=1.0, cihc=1.0, species="human")
```

## Simulate AN response
To simulate an AN response, you need to provide an IHC potential (from the output of `sim_ihc_zbc2014`) in 1D Numpy vector format to the `sim_anrate_zbc2014` function; it will return a prediction of instantaneous AN firing rate rate of exactly the same size and format.
Parameters can be modified by keyword arguments:
- `cf`: Characteristic frequency (Hz)
- `nrep`: Number of reps to simulate, should always match value used in `sim_ihc_zbc2014`
- `fs`: Sampling rate (Hz), should generally be at least 100 kHz, and higher for cat/very-high-CF simulations, should always match value used for `sim_ihc_zbc2014`
- `fibertype`: String encoding which fiber type to simulate in [`"hsr"`, `"msr"`, `"lsr"`]
- `powerlaw`: String encoding whether to use true powerlaw adaptation (`"true"`) or approximate powerlaw adaptation (`"approx"`). In the MATLAB/Mex wrapper, `implnt=1` corresponds to `"true"` and `implnt=0` corresponds to `"approx"`
- `noisetype`: String encoding whether to use no fractional Gaussian noise (`"none"`), or fresh noise (`"fresh"`). In the MATLAB/Mex wrapper, `noiseType=1` corresponds to `"fresh"`

The full function call using default keyword arguments is thus:
```
anrate = sim_anrate_zbc2014(ihc, cf=1e3, nrep=1, fs=100e3, fibertype="hsr", powerlaw="approx", noisetype="fresh")
```

# Developers
This package is setup to build wheels and publish to PyPI whenever the version is incremented. To make any updates, follow these steps:
1. Edit the code, fix bugs, update docs, etc.
2. Bump the version in `src/pyzbc2014/__init__.py`
3. Commit the changes and push to GitHub. For example:
```
git add --all
git commit -m "[commit message]"
git push origin main
```
4. Create and push a matching git tag when ready to upload to PyPI
```
git tag v0.0.1  # this tag needs to match the version in `pyzbc2014/__init__.py`
git push origin v0.0.1  # again, match the tag
```
GitHub Actions should then check the version, build the wheels, and publish to PyPI. Make sure it completes all these steps, then test by installing from PyPI in a clean environment.
